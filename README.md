# Data Analyst Case Study: Cyclistic

## Introduction

As a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic (a bike-sharing company active in Chicago), I am tasked with understanding how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. Casual riders consist of customers that purchase single-ride or full-day passes, whereas annual members subscribe yearly for unlimited biking access. The marketing director theorizes that the company's future success depends on maximizing the number of yearly memberships by converting casual riders into annual members. Pending executive approval, my team will be designing a new marketing strategy that pursues this idea.

To inform any decision-making behind Cyclistic's new marketing strategy, the goal of this project will be to uncover and convey actionable insights.

## About the company

   In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering:
   * 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. 
   * Bicycles variety and flexible pricing.
   * Customer types: members and casual riders
   * Revenue models: annual subscribers, single-ride, and full-day purchasers

   Cyclisticâ€™s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Moreno - Director of Marketing believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a very good chance to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.

   Moreno has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.

## Problem

   We need to **analyze** how and why **Cyclistic casual bikers and members** differ to weigh any evidence, opportunities, and barriers to any future **marketing strategy**.

## Assumption

   * We assume that the data collection procedure was followed correctly. 
   * Furthermore, we proceed with our research under the assumption that the data is free of obvious flaws, bias, and credibility difficulties. 
   * We also presume that the original repository was never accessed or modified without permission.
